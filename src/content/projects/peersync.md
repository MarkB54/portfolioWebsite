title: PeerSync
description: >-
  Built a peer-to-peer file transfer system supporting 10+ concurrent connections using a dual-protocol architecture with UDP for peer coordination and TCP for direct file transfers. Implemented multithreaded heartbeat monitoring with 3-second timeout detection to automatically track and remove inactive peers, while achieving reliable file streaming through 1024-byte chunked transfers across direct peer-to-peer connections.
