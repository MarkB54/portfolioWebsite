Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a consultant where I discovered my passion for solving problems through code. What started as automating spreadsheets and building NLP tools for qualitative analysis turned into a full career pivot - I realised the power of software to transform manual work into scalable solutions, and I wanted to build those systems full-time.

These days, I'm focused on backend architecture and distributed systems - building things like peer-to-peer networks that coordinate file transfers across protocols, or serverless APIs that need to handle concurrent users while keeping costs low. I have also mentored developers at UNSW DevSoc, helping them dip their toes into the world of software development.
