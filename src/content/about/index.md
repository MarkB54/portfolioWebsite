I'm a graduate student at UNSW completing a **Master of Information Technology** with a WAM of 94.125. My background spans law and business — I hold a Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Laws from UTS — and I've transitioned into software development with a focus on full-stack web applications.

Currently, I lead training at UNSW DevSoc, where I architect full-stack applications, mentor junior developers, and foster collaborative development practices. I've also served as Technical Director at QuantSoc and worked as a Senior Consultant at Hall & Partners, where I developed NLP tools and drove process automation.

My technical stack includes **TypeScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Docker/Kubernetes**. I enjoy building scalable systems, writing clean code, and helping others grow as developers.
