This file controls your site's metadata, social links, theme settings, section visibility, and more.\n\n### Basic Information\n\n```typescript\nexport const siteConfig: SiteConfig = {\n  name: \"Your Name\",\n  title: \"Your Title/Tagline\",\n  description: \"Brief description of your portfolio\",\n  avatar: \"../assets/your-avatar.png\",\n  location: \"Your City, Country\",\n  email: \"your@email.com\",\n  // ... more config\n};\n```\n\n### Social Links\n\nAdd your social media profiles:\n\n```typescript\nsocialLinks: {\n  github: \"https://github.com/username\",\n  linkedin: \"https://linkedin.com/in/username\",\n  twitter: \"https://twitter.com/username\",\n  bluesky: \"https://bsky.app/profile/username\",\n  instagram: \"https://instagram.com/username\",\n  youTube: \"https://youtube.com/@username\",\n  codetips: \"https://codetips.cloud/u/username\",\n}\n```\n\nAll fields are optional - only include the platforms you use.\n\n### Theme Settings\n\nChoose between theme selector (dropdown) or theme toggle (checkbox):\n\n```typescript\nenableThemeSelector: true  // true = dropdown, false = checkbox\n```\n\nAvailable themes:\n\n- `light` - Clean light theme (default)\n- `dark` - Dark theme\n- `synthwave` - Retro cyberpunk\n- `retro` - Vintage computing\n- `valentine` - Warm pink tones\n- `dim` - Dimmed dark theme\n\n### Section Visibility\n\nControl which sections appear on your homepage:\n\n```typescript\nsections: {\n  about: true,      // About section\n  projects: true,   // Projects showcase\n  blog: true,       // Latest blog posts\n  work: true,       // Work experience\n  education: true,  // Education history\n  hackathons: true, // Hackathon participation\n  contact: true,    // Contact section\n}\n```\n\nSet any section to `false` to hide it. The Hero section is always visible.\n\n### Extra Links (FAB Flower)\n\nConfigure the floating action button menu:\n\n```typescript\nextraLinks: {\n  enable: true,\n  links: [\n    {\n      link: \"/blog/guide\",\n      icon: BookOpen,\n      label: \"Guide\"\n    },\n    // Add more links...\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nSet `enable: false` to hide the FAB entirely.\n\n## Content Management\n\nBloomfolio offers two powerful ways to manage your content:\n\n### Option 1: Keystatic CMS (Recommended)\n\n**The easiest way to create and edit content without touching code.**\n\nAccess the visual editor at `http://localhost:4321/keystatic` when your dev server is running.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- **Visual Interface**: Form-based content editing with live preview\n- **No File Management**: Keystatic handles file creation, naming, and organization\n- **Image Uploads**: Upload images directly through the interface\n- **Type Validation**: Automatic validation ensures all required fields are filled\n- **Media Embeds**: Easy Spotify, YouTube, Twitter embeds (blog posts only)\n- **Git-Based**: All changes are saved as files in your repository\n\n**Content Types Available:**\n- **Singletons**: Hero, About\n- **Collections**: Blog, Projects, Work, Education, Hackathons\n\n**Learn more:** [Keystatic Documentation](https://keystatic.com/docs)\n\n### Option 2: Direct File Editing (For Developers)\n\nEdit markdown files directly in `src/content/` with your code editor.\n\n**Perfect for:**\n- Bulk content changes\n- Version control workflows\n- Advanced markdown editing\n- Scripting content generation\n\n**Both approaches work together** - changes made in files appear in Keystatic and vice versa!\n\n## Content Collections\n\nBloomfolio uses Astro's Content Collections for type-safe content management. There are 6 collections:\n\n### 1. About Collection\n\nSingle entry describing who you are.\n\n**Location**: `src/content/about/about.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"About Me\"\nphoto: \"https://your-photo-url.com/photo.jpg\"\n---\n\nWrite your bio here using Markdown...\n```\n\n### 2.

It's widely used for documentation, blog posts, and README files because it's easy to write and read.\n\n## What is Markdoc?\n\nMarkdoc is an extension of Markdown used in Bloomfolio that allows you to use custom tags for rich media embeds (Spotify, YouTube, Twitter). Files using Markdoc components must have the `.mdoc` extension.\n\n**Quick Facts:**\n- Standard blog posts: `.md` extension\n- Blog posts with media embeds: `.mdoc` extension\n- Add components via [Keystatic CMS](/keystatic) (visual editor) or manual editing\n- Components currently only available in blog collection\n\n## Markdown Syntax Guide\n\n### Headings\n\nCreate headings using `#` symbols. More `#` symbols mean smaller headings.\n\n```markdown\n# Heading 1\n## Heading 2\n### Heading 3\n#### Heading 4\n##### Heading 5\n###### Heading 6\n```\n\n**Best Practice**: Use only one H1 per page (your title), and maintain proper heading hierarchy (don't skip levels).\n\n---\n\n### Text Formatting\n\n```markdown\n**Bold text** or __Bold text__\n*Italic text* or _Italic text_\n***Bold and italic*** or ___Bold and italic___\n~~Strikethrough text~~\n`Inline code`\n```\n\n**Renders as**:\n\n- **Bold text**\n- *Italic text*\n- ***Bold and italic***\n- ~~Strikethrough~~\n- `Inline code`\n\n---\n\n### Lists\n\n**Unordered Lists**:\n\n```markdown\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n  - Nested item 2.1\n  - Nested item 2.2\n- Item 3\n```\n\n**Ordered Lists**:\n\n```markdown\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n   1. Nested item\n   2. Another nested item\n```\n\n**Task Lists** (GitHub-style):\n\n```markdown\n- [x] Completed task\n- [ ] Incomplete task\n- [ ] Another task\n```\n\n---\n\n### Links\n\n```markdown\n[Link text](https://example.com)\n[Link with title](https://example.com \"Hover text\")\n[Reference-style link][1]\n\n[1]: https://example.com \"Reference URL\"\n```\n\n**Internal Links** (within your site):\n\n```markdown\n[About Page](/about)\n[Blog Post](/blog/my-post)\n[Project](/projects/my-project)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Images\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](./image.png)\n![Image with title](./image.png \"Image title\")\n```\n\n**Best Practices**:\n\n- Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility\n- Use relative paths for local images (`./image.png`)\n- Optimize images before adding (aim for \u003C 1MB)\n- Use meaningful filenames\n\n**Example**:\n\n```markdown\n![A developer coding at a modern workspace with dual monitors](./workspace.jpg)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Code Blocks\n\n**Inline Code**: Use single backticks\n\n```markdown\nUse `const` for variables that won't change.\n```\n\n**Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks with language specification\n\n````markdown\n```javascript\nfunction greet(name) {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\nconsole.log(greet(\"World\"));\n```\n````\n\n**Supported Languages**:\n\n- `javascript` / `js`\n- `typescript` / `ts`\n- `python`\n- `bash` / `sh`\n- `css`\n- `html`\n- `json`\n- `yaml`\n- `markdown` / `md`\n- And many more!\n\n**Code Block with Title**:\n\n````markdown\n```javascript title=\"greet.js\"\nfunction greet(name) {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n```\n````\n\n---\n\n### Blockquotes\n\n```markdown\n> This is a blockquote.\n> It can span multiple lines.\n>\n> And have multiple paragraphs.\n```\n\n**Renders as**:\n\n> This is a blockquote.\nIt can span multiple lines.\n\n**Nested Blockquotes**:\n\n```markdown\n> First level\n>> Second level\n>>> Third level\n```\n\n---\n\n### Horizontal Rules\n\nCreate dividers using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:\n\n```markdown\n---\n***\n___\n```\n\nAll render as a horizontal line.\n\n---\n\n### Tables\n\n```markdown\n| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |\n| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |\n```\n\n**Alignment**:\n\n```markdown\n| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |\n|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|\n| Left         | Center         | Right         |\n```\n\n---\n\n## Markdoc Features\n\nMarkdoc allows you to use custom tags within your markdown files for rich media embeds and interactive components.\n\n### File Extension Requirements\n\n> **⚠️ Important:** Media components (Spotify, YouTube, Twitter) **only work in `.mdoc` files**, not `.md` files.\n>\n> - Use `.md` for standard blog posts\n> - Use `.mdoc` for blog posts with media embeds\n> - Components are currently **only available in the blog collection**\n\n### Content Management Options\n\nYou can add Markdoc components in two ways:\n\n**Option 1: Keystatic CMS (Easier)**\n- Access the visual editor at `http://localhost:4321/keystatic`\n- Click the \"+\" button in the content editor\n- Select Spotify, YouTube, or Twitter component\n- Paste the URL - Keystatic handles the rest\n- Files are automatically saved as `.mdoc`\n\n**Option 2: Manual Editing**\n- Create/rename file with `.mdoc` extension\n- Use `{% %}` tag syntax shown below\n\n### When to Use Markdoc Components vs Plain Markdown\n\n**Use plain Markdown (`.md`) when**:\n\n- Writing simple blog posts\n- No need for interactive components\n- Standard markdown is sufficient\n\n**Use Markdoc tags (`.mdoc`) when**:\n\n- Embedding media (Spotify, YouTube, Twitter)\n- Creating interactive content\n- Using custom components\n- Need advanced formatting\n\n### Using Markdoc Tags\n\nMarkdoc tags are globally registered and don't require imports. Simply use the `{% %}` syntax in your `.mdoc` files:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"My Post\"\ndescription: \"Post description\"\npublishDate: \"2024-01-27\"\n---\n\n# My Post Content\n\nRegular markdown content here...\n\n`{% Spotify url=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/...\" /%}`\n```\n\n### Available Media Components\n\nBloomfolio includes three built-in media components for rich content:\n\n#### Spotify Component\n\nEmbed Spotify tracks, albums, playlists, or podcasts:\n\n`{% Spotify url=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/...\" /%}`\n\n#### YouTube Component\n\nEmbed YouTube videos using either ID or full URL:\n\n`{% YouTube id=\"video-id\" /%}`\nor\n`{% YouTube url=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=...\" /%}`\n\n#### Twitter Component\n\nEmbed tweets using URL or ID:\n\n`{% Twitter url=\"https://x.com/user/status/...\" /%}`\nor\n`{% Twitter id=\"tweet-id\" username=\"username\" /%}`\n\n### Live Examples\n\nWant to see these components in action? Check out the [**Rich Media Embeds Example**](/blog/embed-examples) page which demonstrates all three media components with live examples.\n\n---\n\n## Writing Best Practices\n\n### 1. Structure Your Content\n\n**Good Structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# Main Title\n\nIntroduction paragraph explaining what the post is about.\n\n## First Section\n\nContent for the first section...\n\n### Subsection\n\nMore detailed information...\n\n## Second Section\n\nContent for the second section...\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSummary and next steps...\n```\n\n### 2. Use Meaningful Headings\n\n**Good**:\n\n- `## Installation Steps`\n- `## Common Errors and Solutions`\n- `## Performance Optimization`\n\n**Avoid**:\n\n- `## Part 1`\n- `## More Information`\n- `## Details`\n\n### 3. Break Up Long Paragraphs\n\nKeep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences for better readability:\n\n**Good**:\n\n```markdown\nMarkdown is easy to learn. It uses simple, intuitive syntax that mirrors\nhow people naturally format text in emails.\n\nThe beauty of Markdown is its readability. Even in raw form, it's easy\nto understand what the formatted output will look like.\n```\n\n**Avoid**:\n\n```markdown\nMarkdown is easy to learn and it uses simple, intuitive syntax that mirrors how people naturally format text in emails and the beauty of Markdown is its readability because even in raw form, it's easy to understand what the formatted output will look like and it makes writing documentation much faster.\n```\n\n### 4. Use Code Examples\n\nWhen explaining technical concepts, include code examples:\n\n````markdown\n## Using Array Methods\n\nThe `map()` method creates a new array:\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);\nconsole.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n````\n\n````\n\n### 5. Include Visual Breaks\n\nUse horizontal rules, blockquotes, or images to break up long sections of text:\n\n```markdown\n## Long Topic\n\nFirst part of the content...\n\n---\n\nSecond part of the content...\n\n> Important note: This is a key point to remember.\n\nFinal part of the content...\n````\n\n### 6. Link to Related Content\n\nHelp readers discover more:\n\n```markdown\nFor more information on setting up your portfolio, check out the\n[Complete Guide](/blog/guides/bloomfolio-complete-guide).\n\nLearn how to structure your content in the\n[Content Collections Guide](/blog/guides/content-collections-guide).\n```\n\n---\n\n## SEO Best Practices\n\n### Write Good Meta Descriptions\n\nYour frontmatter description is used for SEO:\n\n```yaml\n---\ndescription: \"Learn Markdown syntax and MDX features in Bloomfolio with this comprehensive guide.\"\n---\n```\n\n**Tips**:\n\n- Keep under 160 characters\n- Include primary keywords\n- Make it compelling\n- Describe what readers will learn\n\n### Use Descriptive Alt Text\n\n```markdown\n![A comparison chart showing Markdown syntax on the left and rendered HTML on the right](./markdown-vs-html.png)\n```\n\n### Structure with Headings\n\nSearch engines use headings to understand content structure. Use them logically:\n\n```markdown\n# Main Topic (H1 - only one per page)\n## Major Section (H2)\n### Subsection (H3)\n#### Minor Point (H4)\n```\n\n### Internal Linking\n\nLink to other pages on your site:\n\n```markdown\nCheck out my [E-commerce project](/projects/ecommerce-platform) for a\npractical example.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility Tips\n\n### 1. Meaningful Link Text\n\n**Good**:\n\n```markdown\nLearn more about [Markdown syntax](https://example.com).\n```\n\n**Avoid**:\n\n```markdown\nLearn more [here](https://example.com).\n```\n\n### 2. Image Alt Text\n\nDescribe the image content, not just what it is:\n\n**Good**:\n\n```markdown\n![Bar chart showing 50% improvement in page load times after optimization](./performance-chart.png)\n```\n\n**Avoid**:\n\n```markdown\n![Chart](./performance-chart.png)\n```\n\n### 3. Heading Hierarchy\n\nDon't skip heading levels:\n\n**Good**:\n\n```markdown\n# Title\n## Section\n### Subsection\n```\n\n**Avoid**:\n\n```markdown\n# Title\n### Subsection  \u003C!-- Skipped H2 -->\n```\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### 1. Inconsistent Spacing\n\nMarkdown needs blank lines between elements:\n\n**Correct**:\n\n```markdown\n## Heading\n\nParagraph text here.\n\n- List item 1\n- List item 2\n```\n\n**Incorrect**:\n\n```markdown\n## Heading\nParagraph text here.\n- List item 1\n- List item 2\n```\n\n### 2. Not Escaping Special Characters\n\nIf you need to display special characters literally, escape them with `\\`:\n\n```markdown\n\\*This text has literal asterisks\\*\n\\# This is not a heading\n```\n\n### 3. Mixing Markdown and HTML Unnecessarily\n\nWhile you can use HTML in Markdown, it's better to use Markdown syntax when possible:\n\n**Prefer**:\n\n```markdown\n**Bold text**\n```\n\n**Over**:\n\n```html\n\u003Cstrong>Bold text\u003C/strong>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Markdown Cheat Sheet\n\nQuick reference for common syntax:\n\n````markdown\n# H1\n## H2\n### H3\n\n**bold**\n*italic*\n~~strikethrough~~\n`code`\n\n- Bullet list\n1. Numbered list\n\n[Link](url)\n![Image](url)\n\n> Blockquote\n\n---\n\n```code block```\n\n| Table | Header |\n|-------|--------|\n| Cell  | Cell   |\n````\n\n---\n\n## Tools & Resources\n\n### Editors\n\n- **VS Code**: Excellent Markdown support with preview\n- **Typora**: WYSIWYG Markdown editor\n- **Obsidian**: Note-taking with Markdown\n- **MarkText**: Free, open-source Markdown editor\n\n### VS Code Extensions\n\n- **Markdown All in One**: Shortcuts and preview\n- **markdownlint**: Linting and style checking\n- **Markdown Preview Enhanced**: Advanced preview features\n\n### Online Tools\n\n- **StackEdit**: Browser-based Markdown editor\n- **Dillinger**: Online Markdown editor with live preview\n- **Markdown Guide**: Comprehensive Markdown reference\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you understand Markdown and Markdoc:\n\n1. **Create Content**: Start writing blog posts with your new skills\n1. **Try Keystatic CMS**: Access the visual editor at [/keystatic](/keystatic) to easily add media embeds\n1. **Experiment with Markdoc**: Try the [embed examples](/blog/embed-examples) in your own posts (remember to use `.mdoc` extension)\n1. **Check Content Guide**: Review the [Content Collections Guide](/blog/guides/content-collections-guide) for schema details\n1. **Read Complete Guide**: See the [Bloomfolio Complete Guide](/blog/guides/bloomfolio-complete-guide) for full setup\n\nHappy writing! 🌼","src/content/blog/guides/markdown-guide.mdoc",[355],"@assets/blog/guides/markdown-guide/image.png","b1714b3b1c845795","guides/content-collections-guide",{"id":357,"data":359,"body":368,"filePath":369,"assetImports":370,"digest":372,"deferredRender":48},{"title":360,"description":361,"image":362,"publishDate":363,"updatedDate":364,"tags":365},"Content Collections Guide","Learn how to create and manage content in Bloomfolio using Keystatic CMS or direct file editing.

Each collection has a defined schema that ensures your content has the required fields and correct data types.\n\nWhether you use Keystatic CMS or edit files directly, all content is stored as files in `src/content/` and validated using these schemas.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Type Safety**: Catch errors before they reach production\n- **Auto-completion**: Get IntelliSense in your editor\n- **Validation**: Ensure content meets requirements\n- **Performance**: Optimized content loading\n- **Organization**: Clear structure for your content\n\n### Collection Locations\n\nAll content lives in `src/content/` with each collection in its own folder:\n\n```\nsrc/content/\n├── about/        # Single about page\n├── blog/         # Blog posts (.md or .mdx)\n├── education/    # Education history\n├── hackathons/   # Hackathon entries\n├── projects/     # Portfolio projects\n└── work/         # Work experience\n```\n\n## Content Collection Schemas\n\nEach collection has a specific schema defined in `src/content.config.ts`. All content files must include frontmatter (YAML between `---` markers) that matches the schema.\n\n### About Collection\n\n**Purpose**: Your personal bio and introduction\n\n**File**: `src/content/about/about.md`\n\n**Schema**:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: string              # Section title\nphoto?: string            # Optional photo URL\n---\n```\n\n**Example**:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"About Me\"\nphoto: \"https://example.com/photo.jpg\"\n---\n\nI'm a passionate developer who loves building beautiful web experiences.\nI specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks and have a keen eye for design.\n\n## What I Do\n\n- Full-stack web development\n- UI/UX design\n- Open-source contributions\n\n## Interests\n\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing\nto open source projects, or sharing knowledge through blog posts and talks.\n```\n\n**Tips**:\n\n- Use the photo field for a professional headshot or avatar\n- Write in first person for a personal touch\n- Include markdown formatting for better readability\n- Highlight your unique skills and interests\n\n---\n\n### Blog Collection\n\n**Purpose**: Articles, tutorials, and blog posts\n\n**Location**: `src/content/blog/*.{md,mdoc}`\n\n> **Tip:** Use [Keystatic CMS](/keystatic) for the easiest way to create blog posts with rich media embeds!\n\n**Schema**:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: string                    # Post title\ndescription: string              # Brief summary (for SEO)\nimage: image()                   # Featured image (relative path)\npublishDate: date                # Publication date\nupdatedDate?: date              # Optional last update date\ntags?: string[]                 # Optional tags/categories\n---\n```\n\n**File Extensions:**\n- `.md` - Standard Markdown for regular blog posts\n- `.mdoc` - Markdoc with component support (required for Spotify, YouTube, Twitter embeds)\n\n> **⚠️ Important:** Media components (Spotify, YouTube, Twitter) only work in `.mdoc` files and are currently only available in the blog collection.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Building Modern Web Apps with Astro\"\ndescription: \"Learn how to create fast, content-focused websites using Astro's islands architecture.\"\nimage: \"./astro-tutorial.png\"\npublishDate: \"2024-01-15\"\nupdatedDate: \"2024-01-20\"\ntags: [\"Astro\", \"Tutorial\", \"Web Development\"]\n---\n\n# Building Modern Web Apps with Astro\n\nAstro is a revolutionary framework for building content-focused websites...\n\n## Why Astro?\n\nAstro brings several advantages to modern web development:\n- Zero JavaScript by default\n- Component islands architecture\n- Framework-agnostic components\n- Excellent performance\n\n## Getting Started\n\nLet's dive into creating your first Astro project...\n```\n\n**Image Paths**:\n\n- Use relative paths (`./image.png`) for images in the same folder as your markdown file\n- Images are automatically optimized by Astro\n- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, WEBP, AVIF, SVG\n\n**Best Practices**:\n\n- Write compelling titles that encourage clicks\n- Keep descriptions under 160 characters for SEO\n- Use 2-5 relevant tags per post\n- Include `updatedDate` when making significant changes\n- Optimize images before adding (aim for \u003C 1MB)\n\n---\n\n### Projects Collection\n\n**Purpose**: Showcase your portfolio work\n\n**Location**: `src/content/projects/*.md`\n\n> **Tip:** Create projects easily through [Keystatic CMS](/keystatic) with the visual editor!\n\n**Schema**:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: string                    # Project name\ndescription: string              # Brief description\nimage: image()                   # Project screenshot\nstartDate: date                  # When you started\nendDate?: date                  # When finished (omit for ongoing)\nskills: string[]                # Technologies used\ndemoLink?: string               # Optional demo URL\nsourceLink?: string             # Optional source code URL\n---\n```\n\n**Example**:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"E-Commerce Platform\"\ndescription: \"A full-stack e-commerce platform with React and Node.js\"\nimage: \"./ecommerce-screenshot.png\"\nstartDate: \"2023-01-15\"\nendDate: \"2023-06-30\"\nskills: [\"React\", \"Node.js\", \"PostgreSQL\", \"Stripe\", \"Tailwind CSS\"]\ndemoLink: \"https://demo.myproject.com\"\nsourceLink: \"https://github.com/username/project\"\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nBuilt a complete e-commerce solution with user authentication, product catalog,\nshopping cart, and payment processing.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- User authentication with JWT\n- Product search and filtering\n- Shopping cart with session persistence\n- Stripe payment integration\n- Admin dashboard for inventory management\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Backend\nThe backend is built with Node.js and Express, utilizing PostgreSQL for data\npersistence.

For online hackathons\n```\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### File Naming\n\nUse descriptive, URL-friendly names:\n\n**Good**:\n\n- `building-modern-web-apps.md`\n- `react-performance-tips.mdx`\n- `ecommerce-platform.md`\n\n**Avoid**:\n\n- `post1.md` (not descriptive)\n- `New Project.md` (spaces)\n- `article_2024.md` (underscores)\n\n### Date Formatting\n\nAlways use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`\n\n```yaml\npublishDate: \"2024-01-25\"\nstartDate: \"2023-06-15\"\n```\n\n### Consistent Frontmatter\n\n- Always include all required fields\n- Use consistent date formats\n- Write clear, concise descriptions\n- Choose relevant, searchable tags\n- Provide meaningful titles\n\n### Image Organization\n\nKeep images organized in the same folder as content:\n\n```\nsrc/content/blog/\n├── my-first-post.md\n├── my-first-post-hero.png\n├── my-first-post-diagram.png\n└── another-post.md\n```\n\nReference with relative paths:\n\n```yaml\nimage: \"./my-first-post-hero.png\"\n```\n\n### Content Quality\n\n1. **Proofread**: Check for typos and grammar\n1. **Structure**: Use clear headings and sections\n1. **Brevity**: Be concise but thorough\n1. **Examples**: Include code examples when relevant\n1. **Links**: Verify all links work correctly\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Frontmatter Validation Errors\n\n**Error**: \"Required property missing\"\n\n- Check `src/content.config.ts` for required fields\n- Ensure all required fields are present in frontmatter\n- Verify field names match exactly (case-sensitive)\n\n**Error**: \"Invalid date format\"\n\n- Use ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD`\n- Ensure dates are quoted: `\"2024-01-25\"`\n- Check for typos in dates\n\n### Images Not Loading\n\n1. **Check path**: Ensure path is correct relative to markdown file\n1. **File extension**: Include extension (.png, .jpg, etc.)\n1. **Case sensitivity**: Match exact case of filename\n1. **Build cache**: Try deleting `dist/` and rebuilding\n\n### Type Errors\n\nIf TypeScript shows errors in content:\n\n- Run `npm run astro check` to see detailed errors\n- Verify schema matches your frontmatter\n- Check that array fields use proper syntax: `[\"item1\", \"item2\"]`\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you understand content collections:\n\n1. **Try Keystatic CMS**: Access the visual editor at [/keystatic](/keystatic) for easy content creation\n1. **Start Creating**: Add your projects, work experience, and education\n1. **Write Blog Posts**: Share your knowledge and experiences\n1. **Add Media Embeds**: Use `.mdoc` files for Spotify, YouTube, Twitter embeds\n1. **Optimize Images**: Use compressed, optimized images\n1. **Check the [Markdown Guide](/blog/guides/markdown-guide)**: Learn markdown and Markdoc syntax\n\nFor setup and configuration, see the [Bloomfolio Complete Guide](/blog/guides/bloomfolio-complete-guide).\n\nHappy creating! 🌼","src/content/blog/guides/content-collections-guide.mdoc",[371],"@assets/blog/guides/content-collections-guide/image.png","a87dedbd77380fc6","contact",["Map",186,375],{"id":186,"data":376,"body":384,"filePath":385,"digest":386,"rendered":387},{"icon":377,"linkUrl":378,"linkText":379,"footerIcon":380,"footerText":381,"footerLinkText":382,"footerLinkUrl":383},"MessageCircleCode","https://x.com/leowg","with a direct question on X (twitter)","Pickaxe","Crafted by an Artisan","Lauro Guedes","https://lauroguedes.dev","Want to chat? shoot me a dm","src/content/contact/index.md","41aa6ca62560b2ce",{"html":388,"metadata":389},"\u003Cp>Want to chat? shoot me a dm\u003C/p>",{"headings":390,"localImagePaths":391,"remoteImagePaths":392,"frontmatter":393,"imagePaths":394},[],[],[],{"icon":377,"linkUrl":378,"linkText":379,"footerIcon":380,"footerText":381,"footerLinkText":382,"footerLinkUrl":383},[],"general",["Map",186,397],{"id":186,"data":398,"filePath":407,"digest":408},{"enableThemeSelector":48,"extraLinksEnabled":48,"extraLinks":399,"showAboutSection":48,"showProjectsSection":48,"showBlogSection":19,"showWorkSection":48,"showEducationSection":48,"showHackathonsSection":19,"showContactSection":19},[400,403,405],{"link":257,"icon":401,"label":258,"displayOn":402},"CodeXml","both",{"link":191,"icon":404,"label":260,"displayOn":402},"Briefcase",{"link":254,"icon":406,"label":255,"displayOn":402},"Mail","src/content/general/index.yaml","8680c6d4aa1bdab5"]
